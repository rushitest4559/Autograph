# ✍️ Autograph: The AI Content Engine

*"At midnight, the magic fades... unless you built it yourself."*

Autograph is not a traditional CMS. It is a Multimodal Content Processing Platform designed to transform raw ideas into production-ready assets. While others just "store and read," Autograph orchestrates AI to transcribe, translate, summarize, and forge content across formats.

## ✨ The Magic (Capabilities)

- **Video-to-Everything**: Automatic transcription and transformation of video into blog posts and social threads.
- **Multilingual Alchemy**: Instant AI-driven localization into dozens of languages.
- **Smart Summarization**: Distilling long-form documents into actionable "golden nuggets."
- **AI-Native Creation**: A collaborative environment where the "Fairy Godmother" (AI) assists in every draft.

## 🛠️ The Magical Arsenal (Tech Stack)

- **The Brain**: Strapi (Headless CMS) for rapid, flexible API orchestration.
- **The Treasury**: PostgreSQL for robust metadata and relational state.
- **The Warehouse**: AWS S3 for durable, infinite object storage.
- **The Courier**: Amazon CloudFront for low-latency global content delivery.
- **The Memory**: Redis for high-speed caching and database offloading.
- **The Alchemist**: Advanced LLMs & Whisper (AI) for core content transformation.
- **The Assembly Line**: ArgoCD & GitHub Actions for 50+ production deployments a day.

## 🏰 Architecture Overview

Autograph is built on a foundation of Infrastructure-as-Code (OpenTofu) and GitOps, ensuring the "castle" is as resilient as the magic it houses.

## 🎯 Who Autograph Is For

Autograph is built for **teams and companies**, not solo users chatting with AI.  
It’s ideal for **startups, SaaS, and dev-focused companies** that update docs, blogs, and content **frequently**.  
Autograph acts as a **system of record** where AI creates and updates content using **historical context**.  
Unlike ChatGPT, it provides **structure, memory, workflows, and APIs** for reuse across products.  
If multiple people touch content weekly, **Autograph fits**—otherwise, it’s overkill.
